The Tox21 Challenge baseline models
===================================

This repository contains a simple implementation of the [naive
Bayes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier) classifier
to provide baseline models for the 12 datasets in the challenge. The
implementation makes use of [LyChI](https://github.com/ncats/lychi)
for structure standardization and
[PCFP](https://bitbucket.org/caodac/pcfp) for descriptor/feature
extraction. Please note that this code is for demonstration
purposes only; we make no claims as to its validity or correctness. We
do, however, encourage you to apply the models as-is (see below for
instructions) and submit the results to get a feel for what to
expect.
